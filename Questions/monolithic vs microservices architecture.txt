monolithic vs microservices architecture
-------------------------------------------------------
monolithic:
----------------
-->monolithic architecture containe all services related to our application will be available in single system 
(ex: travel booking , hotel booking, payments, sign up)
-->whenever a user sends a requests to application via https goes directly to the application server and that application server containe database underline 
--->it iteracts and send data back to user 
-->in here suppose the over all application developed through only one application one perticular language and one perticular framework

advantages:
------------------
-->easy to deploy
-->low complexity

Disadvantages:
---------------------
-->hard to scale
-->slow performance
-->single point of failure (suppose server get crash all services will be down)
-->slow continuos development
-->Rigid 
-->if that servers goes down then over all application down
------------
-->able to do scalig horizontal scalling all application not perticular in terms of perticular specific bussiness functionality
---------------------------------------
Microservices:
---------------------
-->microservices architecture breaks into small small functionalities for small small services 
-->these services are loosly coupled 
-->these services are iteract with each other and each services has own autonomos body 
-->here supports multiple language to develop for different functinality 
Advantages:
----------------
-->loosly coupled 
-->angile and flexible
-->independent development
--> fault isolation
-->mixed techology stack
-->supports granula scalling

Disadvantages:
-----------------
-->high complexity
-->consistency
-->automation 
-->debugging
-------------------------
-->microservices architecture using whenever send a request to microservices services first api gateway get request from gateway api gateway route to related services 
-->each services containe independent database
