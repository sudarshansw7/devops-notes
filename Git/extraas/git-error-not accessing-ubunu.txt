-->This error message is indicating that your ssh key is not properly set up or is not being
 recognized by the GitHub repository you are trying to access. To resolve this issue, you will
 need to set up an ssh key on your local machine and add it to your GitHub account. Here are the steps to do this:

1.Check for existing ssh keys: Open a terminal and enter the command ls ~/.ssh to see if you already have an ssh key. 
If you see a file named id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub, then you already have a key set up and you can skip to step 3.

2.Generate a new ssh key: If you don't already have an ssh key, enter the command 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" to generate a new key. 
This will create a new ssh key pair, which consists of a private key (stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
and a public key (stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub).

3.Add the ssh key to your GitHub account: Go to your GitHub settings and navigate to the "SSH and GPG keys" section. 
Click on "New SSH key" and enter a title for your key (e.g., "my-computer"). Then, copy and paste the contents of
 your public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) into the "Key" field.

4.Test the connection: Run ssh -T git@github.com to test the connection. 
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like "Hi [username]!
 You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."

5.Clone the repository by ssh protocol instead of https.

If you still face the same issue, check the permissions of the ssh folder, and check for the ssh-agent running or not.
