To push code into different github account 
-----------------------------------------------------------
To push code to a different GitHub account, you need to follow these steps:

Set up SSH Keys: Make sure you have SSH keys set up on your local machine. If you haven't done this before, follow these steps:

a. Check for existing SSH keys on your machine:

bash
Copy code
ls ~/.ssh
b. If you don't have any existing keys, generate a new SSH key:

mathematica
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
c. Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent (replace "id_ed25519" with the name of your generated key):

bash
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
d. Add the public SSH key (id_ed25519.pub) to your GitHub account:

Go to your GitHub account settings.
Click on "SSH and GPG keys."
Click on "New SSH key" and paste the contents of your id_ed25519.pub file.
Create a New Repository: If the repository does not exist on GitHub, create a new repository under the desired GitHub account.

Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the SSH URL. Replace "github_username" with the username of the GitHub account where you want to push the code and "repository_name" with the name of the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:github_username/repository_name.git
Add, Commit, and Push Code: Now you can add your code, commit changes, and push to the new repository:

bash
Copy code
cd repository_name
# Add your code and make changes as needed

# Stage the changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Push to the repository
git push origin main
Note: Replace "main" with the name of the branch you want to push to if it's different from the default branch name.

After completing these steps, your code will be pushed to the repository under the different GitHub account that you set up. Remember that you need the appropriate permissions (write access) on the repository to push code successfully. If you encounter any issues during the process, double-check your SSH setup, repository permissions, and credentials (if applicable).
