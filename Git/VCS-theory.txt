Version Controlling
=======================
This is the process of maintianing multiple versions of the code
All the team members uplaod their code(check in) into the remote
version controlling system.The VCS accepts the code uplaods from 
multiple team members and integrates it so that when the other
team members download the code they will be able to see the entire
work donw by the team

VCS's also preserve older and later versions of the code so that
at any time we can switch between which ever version we want

VCS's also keep a track of who is making what kind of changes

======================================================================

VCS's are categorised into 2 types
1 Centralised version controlling
2 Distributed version controlling

Centralised Version controlling
-----------------------------------
Here we have a remote server(code repository) into which all the team 
members check in the code and all the features of version controlling
are implemented in this remote server

 Distributed version controlling
-------------------------------------
Here we have a local repository installed on every team members machines
where version controlling happens at the level of individual team members
form where it is uploaded into a remote server where version cotrolling 
happens for the entire team
