Clone,pull,fetch -------5th session 14:00 min
----------------------------------------------------------
1.in oredered to dowload code from remote repository use three commands 
	--> git clone
	--> git fetch
	--> git pull
git clone
---------------
1.clone command only work for download code from remote github
  to local repository
2.clone will download all data everytime how many times you perform
3.clone is actually one time activity 
	$git clone https://address_path
--------------------------------------------------
git fetch and pull
-------------------------------------------
1.fetch and pull command copy the data from remote repository which is not 
  present in the local repository 
2.these commands works only if modified data and new file avalable at remote 
  repository to copy that modified data into local repository use these commands 
3.clone command copy the entire data every time you perform the command 
4.pull and fetch commands copy the modified data and which is not present in the localrepository
---------
but here pull and fetch some behaviour change 
-->fetch command when file1 changes in remote repository 
   by perform fetch in local repository it will directly not change 
   in the local repositiry file1
   --first it will create a remote branch in that branch file1 modified data available
     and then developer checks code is perfect then he can merge with local file1
     to see remote branch commnad is $ git branch -a 
-->pull command not like fetch 
   if a file1 modified in the remote repository. if developer perform git pull 
   command copy and modified the local repositoy file also 
   --here there are chance to see code is perfect or not
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
push
-----------
1.push command upload the local repository data in into remote resitory 
2.generally to upload data into remote repository there is a order
3.first create a repository in the github
4.make connection between remote repository to local repository 
	
	--git remote add origin git@github.com:thej950/repo1.git  
	--git push -u origin master -- upload data from master branch
	--git push --will upload data from current branch data
	--git push -u origin --all  this command upload all branches data into remote repository
