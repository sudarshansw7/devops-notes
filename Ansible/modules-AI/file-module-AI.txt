The file module in Ansible is used to manage files and directories on the remote servers. It allows you to create, modify, and delete files and directories, and set their permissions and ownership.

add-hoc commands 
------------------------
$asible all -m file -a 'name=/tmp/filename state=touch' -->create a file 
$asible all -m file -a 'name=/tmp/dir1 state=directory'  -->create a directory
$asible all -m file -a 'name=/tmp/filename state=absent'  -->delete a directory or file
$asible all -m file -a 'name=/tmp/filename state=touch owner=sai group=anu mode=770' -b -->changin permissions for file

-----------------------
- name: Copy a file
  ansible.builtin.file:
    src: /path/to/src/file
    dest: /path/to/dest/file

Changing permissions and ownership of a file:

  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /path/to/file

    group: group
    mode: 0644

Creating a directory:
---------------------------
- name: Create a directory

    path: /path/to/directory
    state: directory

The file module is an important tool for managing remote servers, and it can be used in conjunction with other Ansible modules to automate tasks such as deploying software, configuring services, and maintaining system integrity.

It's worth noting that ansible.builtin.file is the legacy way to call the file module, the recommended way is to call the file module directly.
--------------------------
- name: Create a file
  file:
    path: /path/to/file
    state: touch
