why jenkins running on top of ubuntu 
---------------------------------------
Using Jenkins on top of Ubuntu versus running Jenkins as a container can depend on your specific use case and requirements.

Running Jenkins in a container is a popular approach, as it allows for easy deployment and scaling of Jenkins instances. With containers, you can package your Jenkins configuration and dependencies into a single portable image, which can be deployed to any environment that supports Docker.

However, there are some situations where running Jenkins on top of Ubuntu may be preferable. For example:

Access to system resources: If you need access to system resources that are not available to containers, such as hardware devices or specific kernel modules, running Jenkins on top of Ubuntu may be necessary.

Customization: Running Jenkins on top of Ubuntu allows for more customization of the underlying environment, including the installation of additional packages or configuration changes that may not be possible within a container.

Security considerations: If there are specific security considerations or compliance requirements that need to be met, running Jenkins on top of Ubuntu may provide greater control over the underlying environment and access to security tools and utilities.

In summary, running Jenkins in a container is a popular approach for its ease of deployment and scaling, but running Jenkins on top of Ubuntu may be necessary in certain situations where greater customization or access to system resources is needed.
