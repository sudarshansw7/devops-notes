-->137 error

The error code "137" in Docker typically refers to a container that has been killed due to excessive resource usage. More specifically, it indicates that the container has exceeded the memory limit that has been set for it.

When a container starts consuming more memory than its assigned limit, Docker's memory manager sends a SIGKILL signal to the container process, which forces it to terminate immediately. The exit status code of 137 is then returned to indicate that the container was killed due to an out-of-memory (OOM) error.

To resolve this issue, you may need to increase the memory limit for the container or optimize its resource usage. You can try reducing the memory usage of the container by optimizing its code or using a more efficient algorithm. Alternatively, you can increase the memory limit for the container by using the --memory or --memory-reservation options when starting the container.
